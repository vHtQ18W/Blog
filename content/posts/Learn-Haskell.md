最近摸鱼的时候不慎访问了 www.haskell.org ，在官网的模拟 console 中跟寻着简单明了的 _5minutes tutorial_ 随便看了看，觉得 Haskell 异常的有趣，决定找几本 Haskell
的书瞅瞅，这篇博客是我的 Haskell 学习笔记，应该会长期更新下去（不偷懒的话XD）。由于懒惰的缘故，这篇文章将会是扯淡和 copy 混杂的形式，或许会很长。

## Learn You a Haskell for Great Good {#learn-you-a-haskell-for-great-good}

I find this book when visit Haskell website. It's author claims it is funkiest
way to learn Haskell. So I decided to read this book.


### What's Haskell? {#what-s-haskell}

Haskell is a pure functional programming language.


#### What is functional programming language? {#what-is-functional-programming-language}

Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic
computation and list processing applications. Them are based on mathematical
functions. Them are categorized into two groups:

-   Pure functional languages
-   Impure functional languages


#### What is the difference between imperative and functional programming language? {#what-is-the-difference-between-imperative-and-functional-programming-language}

> In imperative languages you get things done by giving the computer a sequence of
> tasks andthen it executes them.
> In purely functional programming you don’t tell the computer what to do as such
> but rather you tell it what stuff is.
