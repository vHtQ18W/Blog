## Learn You a Haskell for Great Good {#learn-you-a-haskell-for-great-good}

I find this book when visit Haskell website. It's author claims it is funkiest
way to learn Haskell. So I decided to read this book.


### What's Haskell? {#what-s-haskell}

Haskell is a pure functional programming language.


#### What is functional programming language? {#what-is-functional-programming-language}

Functional programming languages are specially designed to handle symbolic
computation and list processing applications. Them are based on mathematical
functions. Them are categorized into two groups:

-   Pure functional languages
-   Impure functional languages


#### What is the difference between imperative and functional programming language? {#what-is-the-difference-between-imperative-and-functional-programming-language}

> In imperative languages you get things done by giving the computer a sequence of
> tasks andthen it executes them.
> In purely functional programming you donâ€™t tell the computer what to do as such
> but rather you tell it what stuff is.
